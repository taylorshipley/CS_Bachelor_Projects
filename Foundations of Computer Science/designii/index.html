</header>
</div>
  <p> <span style="font-weight:bold">In</span> 1997 I was born here in Utah and for the following 23 years here I have stayed.
        A few times I have left the state while on vacation, usually to Disneyland in California.
        Other than that I have hardly left Utah, though not for a lack of trying. 
        I had two trips planned this year 2020, to not only leave the state but the country.

    <p> <span style="font-weight:bold">The</span> first trip was to take place the first week of May. 
    After a stressful couple of months I needed to get away. It was January when a
    close friend of mine offered that I join her on a vaction to her hometown Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.
    During the first week of May her town holds a founders festival. There is music, dancing, 
    and lots of food to celebrate the community that they all help build and grow.
    The temperature was optimal too with most days sunny and 82 degrees. Plus 
    we would be staying in her families vaction home that sits right by the beach.
    I was excited for my first international trip and to have a change to relax on the beach.

    <p> <span style="font-weight:bold">The</span> second trip was a 10 day Alaskan Cruise with port stops in Canada. 
    I would have visited every country in North America, if you don't count Greenland as a part of
    North America. The cruise would start in the middle of August, the perfect time of the year for
    an Alaskan Cruise. I planned on going on a hike to a glacier, go whale watching, and gaze at the
    stars far away from city lights. This would have been a first for me too, 
    I have never been on a cruise before.
    </p>
    
    <p> <span style="font-weight:bold">Unfortunatly</span>, the universe had plans that superceeded mine. 
    Arising out of China and quickly spreading around the world the 
    <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html">
        SARS-CoV-2</a>  virus disrupted 
    everything. In the first few months, it became aparrent that cuises where not safe from this disease
    when many cuise ships were infected. Countries refused to allow the ships to doc for fear 
    of spreading the virus to their nation. Eventually things became worse when the 
    <a href="https://time.com/5791661/who-coronavirus-pandemic-declaration/">World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a Pandemic</a>
    So my Alaskan cuise was canceled, quickly followed by my trip to Mexico.
