SELECT TRIP_NAME FROM TRIP WHERE TYPE = 'Hiking' AND DISTANCE > 10;

# 5. List the customer number, customer last name, and customer first name of each customer that lives in New Jersey (NJ), New York (NY) or Pennsylvania (PA). Use the IN operator in your command.
SELECT CUSTOMER_NUM, LAST_NAME, FIRST_NAME FROM CUSTOMER WHERE STATE IN ('NJ', 'NY', 'PA');

# 6. Repeat Exercise 5 and sort the records by state in descending order and then by customer last name in ascending order.
SELECT CUSTOMER_NUM, LAST_NAME, FIRST_NAME FROM CUSTOMER WHERE STATE IN ('NJ', 'NY', 'PA') ORDER BY STATE DESC, LAST_NAME ASC;

# 7. How many trips are in the states of Maine (ME) or Massachusetts (MA)?
SELECT COUNT(STATE) FROM CUSTOMER WHERE STATE IN ('ME', 'MA');

# 8. How many trips originate in each state?
SELECT COUNT(STATE) FROM TRIP GROUP BY STATE;

# 9. How many reservations include a trip price that is greater than $20 but less than $75?
SELECT COUNT(TRIP_ID) FROM RESERVATION WHERE TRIP_PRICE > 20 AND TRIP_PRICE < 75;

# 10. How many trips of each type are there?
SELECT COUNT(TRIP_ID) FROM TRIP GROUP BY TYPE;

# 11. Colonial Adventure Tours calculates the total price of a trip by adding the trip price plus other fees and multiplying the result by the number of persons included in the reservation. List the reservation ID, trip ID, customer number, and total price for all reservations where the number of persons is greater than four. Use the column name TOTAL_PRICE for the calculated field.
SELECT RESERVATION_ID, TRIP_ID, CUSTOMER_NUM, ((TRIP_PRICE + OTHER_FEES) * NUM_PERSONS) AS TOTAL_PRICE FROM RESERVATION WHERE NUM_PERSONS > 4;

# 12. Find the name of each trip containing the word “Pond.”

# 17. What is the longest distance for a biking trip?
SELECT MAX(DISTANCE) FROM TRIP WHERE TYPE = 'BIKING';

# 18. For each trip in the RESERVATION table that has more than one reservation, group by trip ID and sum the trip price. (Hint: Use the COUNT function and a HAVING clause.)
SELECT TRIP_ID, SUM(TRIP_PRICE) FROM RESERVATION GROUP BY TRIP_ID HAVING COUNT(RESERVATION_ID) > 1;

# 19. How many current reservations does Colonial Adventure Tours have and what is the total number of persons for all reservations?
SELECT COUNT(RESERVATION_ID), SUM(NUM_PERSONS) FROM RESERVATION;

# 20. List the reservation ID and trip ID for all trips that occur in the month of July, 2016. There are multiple ways to create this query. Write an alternate command that would produce the same result.

SELECT RESERVATION_ID, TRIP_ID FROM RESERVATION WHERE MONTH(TRIP_DATE) = 7 AND YEAR(TRIP_DATE) = 2016;
