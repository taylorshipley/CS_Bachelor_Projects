<h1>Essay</h1>
<p>
In the photo on screen you see a man in front of various kitchen tools, his name is Andrew Rea. 
Andrew Rea is better known by his alias, Babish which comes from his Youtube cooking channel called Babish Culinary Universe.
The channel is most known for Babish's attempts to recreate recipes featured in film, television, and video games. 
From chilhood classics like Spongebob's Krabby Patty to kevin's famous chili from The Office, Babish has recreated them all.
Babish, a self taught chef, also produces videos to teach views the basics of cooking. The photo here is a screenshot taken from one such video.
</p>

<p>
Babish currently has over 8.5 million Youtube subscribers, or about the total population of Switzerland, all of whom he as won over with his charm and expertise in cooking.
Never forgeting where he started he always knows how to get down to basics and that's why he created the video series Basics with Babish. 
The series focuses on skills and recipes for people of various skill sets from those who have never cooked to amateur chefs.
The first video in the Basics with Babish series was about Essential Kitchen Tools, some of the featured tools can be seen in the photo above.
</p>

<p>
When beginning my culinary journey I started here watching Basics with Babish.
It was important to start with the first episode in the series as it teaches the importance of good kitchen tools and gives recommendations of some at various price points.
Babish also shows the audience what tools he will be using thoughout the rest of the series.
Some of those are on display in the photo above. I choose these items to map because these are also the tools that I either own or hope to own.
Each tool is linked with where you can buy them for yourself and find out more about the tool.
To give credit to Andrew Rea, aka Babish, I have made sure to link his youtube channel and website to their respective logos that appear in the image.
When people ask me what tools to buy I usually sent them a link to Babish's video but now I will sent them my image-map.
